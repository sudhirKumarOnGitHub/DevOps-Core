# Docker ?
Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, ship, and run applications in a lightweight, portable, and consistent environment. It achieves this by using containerization technology.

## 🧠 Learning Path for Docker
- Beginner:
  - Understand images, containers, Dockerfile.
  - Practice basic CLI commands.
  - Use Docker Hub.

- Intermediate:
  - Learn Docker Compose.
  - Work with volumes, networks.
  - Automate builds and tests.

- Advanced:
  - Use Docker in CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI).
  - Manage container orchestration with Kubernetes.
  - Implement security best practices.



## 🐳 1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables you to automate the deployment of applications inside containers.

- 🔹 Container vs Virtual Machine
  - Containers: Share the host OS kernel, lightweight, start in milliseconds.
  - VMs: Include the full OS, heavier, slow to start.
  | Feature       | Containers         | Virtual Machines |
  | ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
  | OS            | Shared host kernel | Full guest OS    |
  | Size          | Lightweight (MBs)  | Heavy (GBs)      |
  | Start-up Time | Seconds            | Minutes          |
  | Isolation     | Process level      | Hardware level   |


## ⚙️ 2. Key Docker Components
- 🔹 Docker Engine
The core software that runs Docker and manages containers.

- 🔹 Dockerfile
  A text file with instructions to build a Docker image.
  
  Example: dockerfile
  ```
  FROM python:3.9
  COPY . /app
  WORKDIR /app
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```

- 🔹 Docker Image
  A read-only template used to create containers. Built from a Dockerfile.

- 🔹 Docker Container
  A running instance of a Docker image.

- 🔹 Docker Hub
  Public registry where Docker images are stored and shared.


## 🛠️ 3. Docker Workflow
Step-by-step:
- Write a Dockerfile

- Build the image
  ```
  $ docker build -t myapp .
  ```

- Run the container
  ```
  $ docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp
  ```

- Push image to Docker Hub
  ```
  $ docker push username/myapp
  ```

## 🧱 4. Docker Compose
Used for running multi-container applications.

```
# docker-compose.yml example:
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"


# Run with:
$ docker-compose up

```


## 🔐 5. Docker Volumes & Networks
- Volumes: Used to persist data:
```
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/data myapp
```
- Networks: Used for container-to-container communication:
```
docker network create mynet
docker run --network=mynet myapp
```


## 📦 6. Common Docker Commands
  | Task                    | Command                               |
  | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
  | List running containers | `docker ps`                           |
  | Stop a container        | `docker stop <container_id>`          |
  | Remove container        | `docker rm <container_id>`            |
  | List images             | `docker images`                       |
  | Remove image            | `docker rmi <image_id>`               |
  | View logs               | `docker logs <container_id>`          |
  | Execute into container  | `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` |


## 🌍 7. Real-World Use Cases
- Microservices: Run different services (e.g., API, DB) in isolated containers.
- CI/CD: Build, test, and deploy applications automatically in containers.
- Dev/Prod Consistency: Same environment everywhere.
- Scalability: Easily scale containers using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
