## 🔄 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- What it means practically:
  - Developers push code changes frequently (often daily) to a shared repository.
  - Every push triggers automated builds and tests using tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

- Why it matters:
  - Errors are caught early.
  - Developers get fast feedback.
  - Avoids "it works on my machine" issues.


## 2. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)
- What it means practically:
  - Once the code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to a staging or production environment.
  - Tools: Jenkins, ArgoCD, Spinnaker, GitLab CI/CD.

- Continuous Delivery:
  - Requires manual approval to deploy to production.

- Continuous Deployment:
  - Goes live automatically after passing tests.

- Why it matters:
  - Faster release cycles.
  - Less risk due to smaller, incremental changes.


## 📦 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- What it means practically:
  - Instead of setting up servers manually, you define infrastructure in code using tools like:
    - Terraform
    - Ansible
    - AWS CloudFormation

- Why it matters:
  - Reproducible, version-controlled environments.
  - Scalable and consistent deployments.


## 🔍 4. Monitoring and Logging
- What it means practically:
  - Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or Datadog to:
    - Monitor system health (CPU, memory, traffic)
    - Track errors and performance
    - Set up alerts on anomalies

- Why it matters:
  - Faster troubleshooting.
  - Better uptime and user experience.


## 🔐 5. Security (DevSecOps)
- What it means practically:
  - Integrate security checks into the pipeline:
    - Static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube)
    - Dependency scanning (e.g., Snyk)
    - Secrets detection (e.g., TruffleHog)

- Why it matters:
  - Prevent vulnerabilities from reaching production.
  - Make security everyone's responsibility.
