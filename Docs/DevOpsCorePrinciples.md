## Core Principles of DevOps

1. Collaboration
	- Breaks the silos between Dev (developers) and Ops (IT teams), enabling better communication and shared responsibility.

2. Automation
	- Everything that can be automated should be â€”> from code builds to testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.

3. Continuous Integration (CI)
	- Developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently; each integration is verified by automated builds and tests.

4. Continuous Delivery (CD)
	- The codebase is always in a deployable state. Every change can be released to production at any time with a click.

5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	- Managing infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.) using machine-readable definition files (like Terraform, CloudFormation).

6. Monitoring and Logging
	- Proactively monitoring applications and infrastructure to detect issues and improve system reliability.

7. Security (DevSecOps)
	- Integrating security at every stage of the development lifecycle, not just at the end.
