## What is DevOps?
- DevOps is a combination of "Development" and "Operations" — it's a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that aims to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT operations. The goal is to shorten the software development life cycle (SDLC) and deliver high-quality software continuously.


## Key Concepts of DevOps:
- Collaboration: Developers and operations teams work together instead of in silos.
- Automation: Repetitive tasks like testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring are automated.
- Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently merge code changes into a central repository where automated builds and tests run.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): Automatically deploying code to production or staging environments after successful tests.
- Monitoring and Feedback: Applications and infrastructure are constantly monitored, and feedback is used to improve the process.


## DevOps Tools (Examples):
- Version Control: Git, GitHub, GitLab
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
- Configuration Management: Ansible, Puppet, Chef
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Benefits:
- Faster software releases
- Better collaboration between teams
- Higher software quality and reliability
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Reduced manual errors through automation



## What is DevOps
DevOps is not a framework or a workflow.
DevOps ensures collaboration and communication between software engineers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
With DevOps, changes make it to production faster. Resources are easier to share. And large-scale systems are easier to manage and maintain.

Whether you are new to DevOps or looking to review the fundamentals, these repository can help.

the core value of CAMS (culture, automation, measurement, and sharing). 

## The foundations of DevOps
- DevOps is a collaborative way of delivering software and systems that improves your technical and business outcomes, and working environments.
- But the universe of modern technology is vast, and there are many people in it that speak different languages and have different skills.
- They don't always get along, but in the end they all have to work together to create solutions, and that's what DevOps does.
- You'll learn new skills and abilities to apply DevOps to the people, processes, and technology in your team and organization.
- you'll also level up  your understanding of key areas like continuous integration, continous delivery, infrastructure as code and site reliability engineering.

## What is DevOps?
- DevOps, you've probably seen the term or heard it used, but it's not always clear what people mean by it. Okay, so let me ask you, what do you think it means?

- The term DevOps itself combines two traditional roles in tech,
  the developers, who typically write application code, and
  the operations engineers, who set up and manage the systems that the applications run on top of.
  These two bodies of work combine to create an overall service that people can use.

- But these roles keep changing as technology changes. And in the late 2000s, it became clear that it didn't make sense to keep these roles as two completely 
  disconnected groups. And so DevOps was born.

- DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers working together through the entire service lifecycle, from the design and development process, all the way to production support, including both the applications and the systems.

- Of course, there are lots of specialized roles in the IT world. Front-end devs, back-end devs, test engineers, build engineers, networking engineers, and security engineers, database admins, database admins, and so on, in simple word, everyone who practices and participates in creating and running a service fit inside of DevOps. The intent of devOps is to bring them all together to collaborate instead of just having them do their work in isolation and hoping that everything works smoothly when finally brought together.

- DevOps is also characterized by operations engineers using development techniques for their systems work.
- In DevOps, systems engineering works just like a software development workflow. Code to create, configure, and operate the system is checked into source control 
  to go through build, test, and deployment. It's a change from the largely manual system administration processes of the past.

- But we understand that that's a broad enough definition. It doesn't really tell you much about what it is.

- We like to break explaining DevOps down into three levels,
  - the values,
  - the principles, and
  - the practices.
  We'll discuss these three levels in details one by one.

- But first, let's address the big question. Why should you care? What can DevOps do for you? And why would you want to practice it?
  The bottom line is that DevOps is shown to be effective in improving both IT and business outcomes. Google's DevOps Research and Assessment Team does an annual 
  global survey of all kinds of IT organizations to perform statistically sound analysis on what IT practices correlate to successful business results.
  The 2021 State of DevOps Report indicated that there's a big difference between elite and low-performing IT teams, and that the gap is getting larger.
  Elite teams deployed changes 973 times more frequently with 6,570 times shorter lead times than low IT performers.
  And while you might think that moving more quickly would produce lower quality, instead, they had three times fewer failures and recovered from issues 6,570 
  times faster than those low-performing organizations.
  And those elite teams are much more likely to be using DevOps practices like continuous integration, site reliability engineering, and deployment automation.

- Statistically, companies that are high IT performers spend 22% less time on unplanned work and rework, and they're more than twice as likely to achieve their organizational objectives, ship products, and attain customer satisfaction. And perhaps most importantly for those of us who do the work, this heightened productivity actually makes practitioners half as likely to suffer from burnout. These benefits are huge. and the survey showed that these results held true across different sizes and types of businesses, including for-profit and not-for-profit organizations.

- It also works for both product engineering type organizations and internal IT organizations. Different DevOps practices and tools are more relevant for one type of work or another, but at a high level, the principles and methods help all kinds of technology teams.

## what DevOps is not for?
It's not just a new name for an operations team, or 
a new name for an existing job title. 
It's not one person doing every single job, and it doesn't require using any specific tool. 
Keep in mind that a lot of people use the term DevOps without really understanding what it means. 
So always check what you're hearing against the core concepts of DevOps.

DevOps is a powerful methodology, but it is not for everything. 

Here are key things DevOps is not for:

- 🚫 Not a Replacement for Development or Operations: 
  DevOps doesn’t eliminate the need for developers or operations engineers. It's a collaboration model, not a replacement.

- 🚫 Not a Tool or Just Automation:
  DevOps is not just Jenkins, Docker, or Kubernetes. Tools support DevOps, but DevOps is a culture and mindset, not a single tool or tech stack.

- 🚫 Not a One-Time Setup:
  You can’t just “do DevOps” once. It's not a project with an end date—it’s a continuous process of improvement.

- 🚫 Not Only for Large Enterprises:
  Although large companies benefit from DevOps, it’s not exclusive to them. Startups and small teams can also apply DevOps practices.

- 🚫 Not Waterfall with Automation:
  DevOps is not compatible with rigid, linear processes. If you're still using waterfall methods and just automating parts, that’s not true DevOps.

- 🚫 Not Just CI/CD:
  Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are only a part of DevOps. DevOps also includes monitoring, feedback, collaboration, and agile practices.

- 🚫 Not a Silver Bullet:
  DevOps won’t automatically fix bad code, poor communication, or weak business strategy. It amplifies both strengths and weaknesses.
