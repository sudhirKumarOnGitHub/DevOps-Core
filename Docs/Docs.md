## üë∑ Real-world DevOps Flow Example:
1. Dev writes code on feature branch.

2. Push to Git triggers a CI pipeline:
- Code linting
- Unit and integration tests
- Build Docker image

3. Pipeline builds and stores artifacts in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

4. If successful, CD pipeline:
- Deploys to staging (e.g., via Kubernetes)
- Runs automated acceptance tests

5. With approval (or automatically), code is deployed to production.

6. Monitoring dashboards and alerts notify if anything goes wrong.

7. Logs and metrics are collected for analysis and optimization.
