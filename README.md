This repository covers core DevOps concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.


## What is DevOps ?


## DevOps workflow?
A DevOps workflow outlines the stages and practices followed to enable continuous development, integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring of applications.

The goal is to deliver software faster, with higher quality, and in a more reliable and repeatable manner.

Here is a typical DevOps workflow:
- 🔁 1. [Plan](./DevOps_workflow/Plan.md)
- 💻 2. [Develop](DevOps_workflow/Develop.md)
- 🔧 3. [Build](DevOps_workflow/Build.md)
- 🧪 4. [Test](DevOps_workflow/Test.md)
- 📦 5. [Release](DevOps_workflow/Release.md)
- 🚀 6. [Deploy](DevOps_workflow/Deploy.md)
- 🔍 7. [Operate](DevOps_workflow/Operate.md)
- 📊 8. [Monitor & Feedback](DevOps_workflow/MonitorAndFeedback.md)
- repeat from stage 1 based on feedback for continous improvement of software.

🔁 Continuous Feedback Loop: Feedback from monitoring feeds back into planning and development for continuous improvement.
