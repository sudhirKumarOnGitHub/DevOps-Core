# DevOps_Core

# A repository that covers core DevOps concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.


## DevOps
   - a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops)
   - which is a set of practices, cultural philosophies, and tools that increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity.
	
## What is DevOps?
   - DevOps is a software development methodology that aims to bridge the gap between software development and IT operations. 
   - The goal is to shorten the development lifecycle, ensure continuous delivery, and maintain high software quality.
	
## Core Principles of DevOps

1. Collaboration
	- Breaks the silos between Dev (developers) and Ops (IT teams), enabling better communication and shared responsibility.

2. Automation
	- Everything that can be automated should be —> from code builds to testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning.

3. Continuous Integration (CI)
	- Developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently; each integration is verified by automated builds and tests.

4. Continuous Delivery (CD)
	- The codebase is always in a deployable state. Every change can be released to production at any time with a click.

5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	- Managing infrastructure (servers, networks, etc.) using machine-readable definition files (like Terraform, CloudFormation).

6. Monitoring and Logging
	- Proactively monitoring applications and infrastructure to detect issues and improve system reliability.

7. Security (DevSecOps)
	- Integrating security at every stage of the development lifecycle, not just at the end.
		
## Typical DevOps Lifecycle

1. Plan: 
	- Define project goals, tasks (Jira, Trello).

2. Develop: 
	- Write code (VS Code, Git).

3. Build: 
	- Compile and build packages (Maven, Gradle).

4. Test: 
	- Automated testing (Selenium, JUnit).

5. Release: 
	- Version control and deploy (Git, Jenkins).

6. Deploy: 
	- Deploy to production (Docker, Kubernetes).

7. Operate: 
	- Manage environment (Terraform, Ansible).

8. Monitor: 
	- Logs and performance metrics (ELK, Prometheus).

## Benefits of DevOps
- Faster delivery of features

- More stable operating environments

- Improved collaboration between teams

- Faster problem resolution

- Increased efficiency through automation
	
	
## Challenges in DevOps
- Cultural resistance to change

- Tool sprawl — too many tools and platforms

- Maintaining security and compliance in automated pipelines

- Ensuring data consistency and reliability
