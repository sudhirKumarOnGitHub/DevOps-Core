# DevOps_Core
This repository covers core DevOps concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.


## What is DevOps ?


## DevOps workflow?
- A DevOps workflow outlines the stages and practices followed to enable continuous development, integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring of applications.
- The goal is to deliver software faster, with higher quality, and in a more reliable and repeatable manner.

Here is a typical DevOps workflow:
- 🔁 1. Plan
- 💻 2. Develop
- 🔧 3. Build
- 🧪 4. Test
- 📦 5. Release
- 🚀 6. Deploy
- 🔍 7. Operate
- 📊 8. Monitor & Feedback
- repeat from stage 1 based on feedback for continous improvement of software.


## 🔁 1. Plan
- Goal: Clear roadmap and requirements.
- Tools: Jira, Trello, Azure Boards
- Activities: Define user stories, tasks, features, and release plans.


## 💻 2. Develop
- Goal: Modular, testable, and readable code.
- Tools: Git, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
- Activities: Code development, version control, and peer code reviews.
- Practices: Feature branching, pull requests.


## 🔧 3. Build
- Goal: Detect build issues early.
- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, CircleCI
- Activities: Code is built (compiled, packaged) automatically.
- Practices: Build automation and validation.


## 🧪 4. Test
- Goal: Ensure code quality and functionality.
- Tools: Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Postman, SonarQube
- Activities: Run unit, integration, performance, and security tests.
- Practices: Automated testing, static code analysis.


## 📦 5. Release
- Goal: Ready-to-deploy software.
- Tools: Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Azure Pipelines
- Activities: Manage versioning, create release notes, prepare artifacts.
- Practices: Tagging, packaging.


## 🚀 6. Deploy
- Goal: Reliable and automated deployment.
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Helm, Terraform
- Activities: Deploy to test/staging/production environments.
- Practices: Infrastructure as Code (IaC), rolling or blue-green deployments.


## 🔍 7. Operate
- Goal: High availability and performance.
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/Azure/GCP, Ansible
- Activities: Maintain infrastructure and environment stability.
- Practices: Monitoring resources, scaling, configuration management.


## 📊 8. Monitor & Feedback
- Goal: Identify and resolve issues early, improve next cycle.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, New Relic, Splunk
- Activities: Log aggregation, monitoring, alerts, and feedback collection.
- Practices: Observability and proactive alerting.


## 🔁 Continuous Feedback Loop
- Feedback from monitoring feeds back into planning and development for continuous improvement.
