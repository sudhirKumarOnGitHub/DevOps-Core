# DevOps-Core
This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of core DevOps concepts, combining clear theoretical explanations with hands-on practical implementations.

## DevOps ?
From a practical point of view, DevOps is not just a set of tools or processes, but a culture and workflow that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality. 

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that aims to shorten the software development lifecycle, improve collaboration, and automate everything — from code commits to production deployment.

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. This Repository enables Learers to understand various aspects of how they could enable a DevOps culture in their team/org.

- 🧩 Why DevOps Exists:
  - Developers want to release faster.
  - Ops want stability.
  - DevOps bridges the two by automating and standardizing workflows.
