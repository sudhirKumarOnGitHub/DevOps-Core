This repository provides a comprehensive exploration of core DevOps concepts, combining clear theoretical explanations with hands-on practical implementations.

## DevOps ?
From a practical point of view, DevOps is not just a set of tools or processes, but a culture and workflow that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality. 

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that aims to shorten the software development lifecycle, improve collaboration, and automate everything â€” from code commits to production deployment.

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. This Repository enables Learers to understand various aspects of how they could enable a DevOps culture in their team/org.

- ðŸ§© Why DevOps Exists:
  - Developers want to release faster.
  - Ops want stability.
  - DevOps bridges the two by automating and standardizing workflows.
