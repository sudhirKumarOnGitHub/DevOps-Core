# DevOps-Core
This repository covers core DevOps concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

## DevOps ?
- From a practical point of view, DevOps is not just a set of tools or processes, but a culture and workflow that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better quality. 

- DevOps is a culture and set of practices that aims to shorten the software development lifecycle, improve collaboration, and automate everything â€” from code commits to production deployment.

- ðŸ§© Why DevOps Exists:
  - Developers want to release faster.
  - Ops want stability.
  - DevOps bridges the two by automating and standardizing workflows.
