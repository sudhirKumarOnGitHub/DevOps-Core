# DevOps_Core
This repository covers core DevOps concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.


## practical DevOps learning path
Here's a practical DevOps learning path designed for someone who wants hands-on skills and real-world tools, with progression from beginner to advanced level.
- 🧱 Phase 1: DevOps Foundations
- 💻 Phase 2: Essential Skills & Tools
- 🛠️ Phase 3: CI/CD and Automation
- ☁️ Phase 4: Cloud & Kubernetes
- 🔍 Phase 5: Monitoring, Security & Advanced Topics
- 🎓 Phase 6: Real Projects & Certification


## 🧱 Phase 1: Foundations
- 🔧 1. Understand the Basics
  - Learn what DevOps is – Goals, culture, and lifecycle (CI/CD, automation, monitoring).
  - Key Concepts: Agile, SDLC, Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment.
  - 📘 Resources:
    - [DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops)
    - [DevOps_Foundations](Docs/DevOps_Foundations.md)


## 💻 Phase 2: Essential Skills & Tools
- ⚙️ 2. Version Control – Git
  - Git basics: clone, push, pull, branches
  - GitHub/GitLab for collaboration
  Practical Task: Create a repo, use branches, and perform merges with pull requests.

- 🖥️ 3. OS & Shell Scripting
  - Focus on Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS) basics
  - Learn Bash scripting and commands
  Practical Task: Write shell scripts to automate backups and logs rotation.

- 🐳 4. Containers – Docker
  - Understand Dockerfiles, images, volumes, networks
  - Learn how to build and run containers
  Practical Task: Containerize a simple Python or Node.js app.


## 🛠️ Phase 3: CI/CD and Automation
- 🔁 5. Continuous Integration – Jenkins / GitHub Actions
  - Set up a basic Jenkins pipeline
  - Automate testing and builds
  Practical Task: Build a Jenkins pipeline to run tests on every code push.

- ☁️ 6. Configuration Management – Ansible
  - Playbooks, roles, variables, inventory
  Practical Task: Use Ansible to install NGINX on multiple servers.


## ☁️ Phase 4: Cloud & Kubernetes
- ☁️ 8. Cloud Platforms – AWS / Azure / GCP
  - Start with AWS: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch
  Practical Task: Deploy a Dockerized app to EC2 and store logs in S3.

- ☸️ 9. Kubernetes (K8s)
  - Pods, Deployments, Services, Ingress
  - Helm for package management
  Practical Task: Deploy a multi-container app in a Kubernetes cluster (minikube or EKS).


## 🔍 Phase 5: Monitoring, Security & Advanced Topics
- 📊 10. Monitoring & Logging
  - Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  Practical Task: Monitor a live app using Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.

- 🔐 11. DevSecOps Basics
  - Secrets management with HashiCorp Vault
  - Secure Docker and Jenkins configurations
  Practical Task: Scan a Docker image for vulnerabilities with Trivy or Aqua.


## 🎓 Phase 6: Real Projects & Certification
- 💼 12. Capstone Projects
  - Project 1: End-to-End CI/CD for microservices with monitoring
  - Project 2: Kubernetes deployment with Helm + custom domain + TLS
  - Project 3: Infrastructure-as-Code using Terraform for AWS

- 🏅 13. Certifications (Optional but Valuable)
  - AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional
  - CKA – Certified Kubernetes Administrator
  - HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate
